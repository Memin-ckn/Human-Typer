# Human-Typer
Type like a human. Yes, I am talking to you!

We all know about how some sites like Docs track and record your inputs right? Some professors watch your inputs and if you just copy and paste a 24-page essay at once they know it wasn't you who wrote it. This program lets you copy from your preferred LLM and and it will automatically write the text for you. Don't have to do anything mate.

Good luck!
